# Crop-Guardian

**মাঠের সৎ ডাক্তার** — a Bengali, mobile-first UI for advising potato farmers on late blight, and paddy farmers on rice blast: daily risk from the weather, leaf photo diagnosis that admits uncertainty (potato now; paddy as soon as its model is trained, see [Paddy diagnosis](#paddy-diagnosis)), an area risk map, and a season ledger. Every number on screen comes from a real source: the weather forecast, the farmer's own records on the phone, or cases an agriculture officer has confirmed. There is no sample or demo data.

Built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4.

## Why potato late blight

This is a deliberate focus: one crop and one disease done honestly, rather than many done thinly.

- **Potato is a main winter crop of northern Bangladesh**, and late blight (নাবি ধসা) is its most destructive disease. A 16-district survey found it cuts yields by up to 30% ([Potato Research, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11540-022-09581-w)).
- **It is driven by the weather**, so it can be forecast. Fog and cold, wet spells in December–January spread it within days. A warning the afternoon before lets a farmer spray in time, and a quiet forecast saves the calendar sprays most farmers pay for anyway (the [season ledger](#season-ledger)).
- **It has look-alikes** (early blight, other leaf spots), which is where a photo check that admits doubt helps most.

**Pests are not covered.** The challenge asks for pests and diseases. We chose to cover one disease end to end (forecast, SMS alert, photo check, officer review, ledger) first. The pieces are built to grow:

- **More crops and diseases.** Crops are a registry (`src/lib/crops.ts`), and paddy blast already runs on it as a draft rule (experimental).
- **More photo classes and crops.** Each crop's photo model, classes and thresholds come from its own exported config (`src/lib/diagnosis/crops.ts`). Paddy diagnosis is built end to end and waits only for its trained model ([`notebooks/paddy_training.ipynb`](notebooks/paddy_training.ipynb)); pests such as potato tuber moth or aphids would be new classes the same way.
- **More places.** The area list already covers the 17 potato districts of Rangpur and Rajshahi divisions and Munshiganj, down to unions.

See [Limitations and next steps](#limitations-and-next-steps) for what is not yet validated.

## Late-blight risk

Home's risk is computed from the weather, with no ML. `src/lib/weather.ts` fetches a 5-day hourly forecast (temperature, relative humidity) at the centroid of the farmer's union (or Shibganj upazila, Bogura, before one is chosen) from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) (no API key, cached for 1 hour, 5 s timeout). `src/lib/risk.ts` applies the Hutton criteria to it:

- A day **qualifies** when its min temperature is ≥ 10°C and RH ≥ 90% for ≥ 6 hours.
- **বিপদ (danger)**: the day and the day before or after it both qualify (a Hutton period).
- **সতর্ক (watch)**: the day qualifies alone, or is ≥ 10°C with 4–5 humid hours.
- **নিরাপদ (safe)**: otherwise.
- Today's overall risk is today's level, raised to watch if a danger day falls within the next 2 days.

The same result is served as JSON at `GET /api/risk` (optional `lat`, `lon`, by default the farmer's union; optional `crop=potato|paddy`, potato by default). If the forecast can't be fetched, Home says so ("আবহাওয়ার তথ্য আনা যায়নি") and shows no risk at all, never an old or made-up one.

The header line under the risk and the text under today's decision are generated from the forecast numbers. When a danger day is ahead it is named from the forecast, never as a fixed weekday, with the afternoon before it. A farmer with [SMS alerts](#sms-alerts) on is promised a text then ("বুধবার থেকে ঝুঁকি বাড়বে। কাল বিকেলে SMS-এ জানাব।"); anyone else is asked to look again ("… কাল বিকেলে আবার দেখে নিন।"), with a link to turn alerts on. The app never promises a message it won't send. Both lines are kept to two lines on a phone; the tests guard their length.

### Past weather

To check the rule against past winters, list every danger day in the last three Dec–Feb winters:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/find-hutton-periods.ts            # add --write to update docs/risk-backtest.md
```

[docs/risk-backtest.md](docs/risk-backtest.md) compares how often the app's rule and a stricter one (≥ 10 humid hours) would have alerted in those winters, using two independent sources of past weather: the Open-Meteo archive and [NASA POWER](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/) (MERRA-2, `fetchHourlyNasaPower` in `src/lib/weather.ts`). The two sources agree on only a third to a half of the danger days. NASA POWER is coarser (about 50 km) and its humidity rarely stays at 90% for long, so it finds fewer danger days, and almost none under the stricter rule. That spread is a finding in itself: the rule depends on the humidity of whichever weather model feeds it. It needs checking against a field station and real outbreak dates (see [Limitations](#limitations-and-next-steps)).

## Rice-blast risk (paddy, experimental)

Paddy fields get rice-blast risk from the same forecast (`src/lib/blast.ts`), with no ML and no extra request. It is a draft BLASTAM-style rule, to be confirmed with BRRI before farmers rely on it, so Home labels it "পরীক্ষামূলক". Open-Meteo has no leaf wetness, so an hour at RH ≥ 90% stands in for a wet leaf:

- A **wet hour** has RH ≥ 90% at 18–28°C. A day **qualifies** with ≥ 10 wet hours.
- **বিপদ**, **সতর্ক** (a lone qualifying day, or 7–9 wet hours) and **নিরাপদ**, and the 2-day lookahead, work as for late blight; both rules share `classifyRun`, `overallRisk` and `buildDecision` in `risk.ts`.
- The header line names the wet hours from the forecast, or says the humid hours are too cold or too hot for blast. The decision text asks the farmer to look for eye-shaped spots on the leaves, and at the panicle neck on danger days.

`src/lib/crops.ts` is the one place per crop: names, disease, titles, decision text, rule, and the season windows below. Screens read it rather than naming আলু, ধসা or Hutton.

```bash
npx tsx scripts/find-blast-periods.ts             # add --write to update docs/blast-backtest.md
```

[docs/blast-backtest.md](docs/blast-backtest.md) counts alerts over the last 3 Boro (Jan–Apr) and Aman (Aug–Oct) seasons for the app's rule and a looser and a stricter one. Boro is quiet (1–5 alerts a season), but the monsoon keeps Aman humid, and 40–46% of Aman days come out as danger: the rule likely needs a stricter Aman threshold, or rain and growth stage, once BRRI has reviewed it.

## Camera

`/camera` opens the phone's rear camera (`getUserMedia`) inside the leaf frame and checks every ~300 ms, on a 160 px copy of the visible frame, with no ML (`src/lib/imageQuality.ts`):

- **Light**: mean luma below 60 → "আলো কম", above 215 → "আলো খুব বেশি".
- **Focus**: variance of the Laplacian below `BLUR_THRESHOLD` (100) → "ফোন স্থির রাখুন". In dev the values are logged to the console as `[quality]` for tuning.
- **Leaf**: share of Excess-Green (2G − R − B) pixels inside the leaf frame: almost none → "পাতা ফ্রেমের ভেতরে আনুন", too few → "আরো কাছে আনুন".

The farmer takes two photos: for potato, the top of the leaf, then the underside; for paddy, two different affected leaves (the paddy training photos are single leaves from above). Which crop the camera diagnoses comes from `?crop=` in the link, else the field Home last showed, else the first field in season (`src/lib/diagnosis/pickCrop.ts`); once more than one crop has a model, an আলু / ধান switch under the viewfinder changes it and starts a fresh pair. A photo that fails the checks asks "… তবুও রাখবেন?" before it is kept. Photos are saved on the device as JPEGs (≤ 1024 px, quality 0.85) in IndexedDB (`src/lib/captureStore.ts`) for a future diagnosis upload, and the top photo is shown on `/result/uncertain`.

**The camera needs a secure context: HTTPS, or `http://localhost`.** Opening the dev server from a phone over `http://<LAN-IP>:3000` has no `getUserMedia`, so the screen falls back to the phone's own camera app via a file picker. To test the live camera on a real phone, use `next dev --experimental-https` or an HTTPS tunnel. If camera permission is denied, the screen shows "ক্যামেরার অনুমতি দিন" with a retry button.

### Season

Risk is shown only while a crop is in the field (`src/lib/season.ts`, windows in `crops.ts`):

| Field | Risk from | Risk until | Without a date |
|---|---|---|---|
| আলু | planting + 15 days (emergence) | planting + 100 (harvest) | 15 Nov – 15 Mar |
| বোরো ধান | transplanting + 15 (established) | transplanting + 110 | 1 Jan – 15 May |
| আমন ধান | transplanting + 15 | transplanting + 110 | 15 Jul – 15 Nov |

The paddy windows are drafts for common BRRI varieties; harvest varies by variety.

The farmer's fields are set on `/planting` and kept on the device in localStorage (`src/lib/fields.ts`): at most one per season, so the season is the field's id. The union stays one per phone. A phone from before fields had one potato date (`crop-guardian:planting-date`); it becomes the potato field, and is kept in step with it so an older version still finds it. Without any field, Home assumes the usual potato season, as before, and asks for the union and a field.

When several fields are in season, Home shows a chip for each. The server renders every crop's header, strip and decision from the one forecast, and `FieldsGate` shows the farmer's last chip, else the riskiest. Outside every window Home shows the crop's off-season title (e.g. "এখন ধসা রোগের মৌসুম নয়") and the date alerts start, instead of a risk.

The server can't read localStorage, so Home is rendered as if no field is set, and the saved fields take over right after the page loads.

## Diagnosis

The leaf photos are diagnosed on the phone, with no server. Each crop has its own model and calibrated config, exported by a training notebook and listed in `src/lib/diagnosis/crops.ts` (potato: EfficientNet-B0, `public/model/crop_guardian_v2.onnx` and `crop_guardian_config.json`; paddy: `public/model/paddy/`). The worker holds one crop's model at a time, and a diagnosis record keeps its crop, so the result screens, questions, advice and the officer's summary all follow it (records saved before paddy are potato). Classes, Bengali labels, preprocessing, temperature and thresholds are all read from the config; none are written in the code. The model's data, test metrics, calibration, conformal coverage and OOD results are in the **[model card](docs/model-card.md)**.

- `src/lib/diagnosis/worker.ts` runs [onnxruntime-web](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/get-started/with-javascript/web.html) (wasm, one thread) in a Web Worker, so the camera never freezes. The camera screen starts it; the first time it downloads the model and the wasm (about 30 MB, "মডেল নামাচ্ছি… একবারই লাগবে") and keeps them in the Cache API. The wasm is copied from `node_modules` into `public/ort/<version>/` by `scripts/copy-ort.mjs` on install, dev and build: nothing comes from a CDN.
- `preprocess.ts`: shorter side to 255, centre crop 224, scale, mean/std, NCHW float32, with torchvision's rounding.
- `decide.ts` follows `decision` in the config exactly: softmax of the disease logits at temperature T, the conformal set `p ≥ 1 − qhat`, and the OOD score. A photo is **unknown** if the OOD score is over the threshold or the set is empty, **confident** if the set has one class, otherwise **uncertain**. With the current config (`1 − qhat ≈ 0.89`), one photo is never uncertain.
- `combine.ts` decides each photo on its own (the thresholds were calibrated per photo) and keeps the more cautious result: unknown > uncertain > confident. Two confident photos that disagree become uncertain with both classes.

Confident opens `/result`, uncertain `/result/uncertain`, unknown `/unknown`. From uncertain, `/questions` asks only the questions that split the candidates left (`src/lib/diagnosis/questions.ts`): rings inside the spots, and white growth under the leaf. "জানি না" rules nothing out. If one class is left, `/result` shows it as "ছবি আর আপনার উত্তর মিলিয়ে", not "নিশ্চিত", because the answers aren't calibrated like the model. The result is kept on the device (IndexedDB) with the photos. "কেন মনে হলো?" lists only real inputs: what each photo gave, today's weather risk from `/api/risk`, and the farmer's answers. Advice per class is fixed text in `content.ts` that never gives a dose (always "লেবেল অনুযায়ী") and should be reviewed by an agronomist. Every potato result says "পরীক্ষামূলক: ইন্দোনেশিয়ার মাঠের ছবিতে যাচাই করা": its thresholds were fitted on Indonesian field photos, not Bangladeshi ones.

"কৃষি কর্মকর্তাকে পাঠান / দেখান" (on every result screen and at the end of the questions) uses the phone's share sheet (Web Share API) with both leaf photos and a short Bengali summary: date, place, the app's result and candidates, and the farmer's answers (`src/lib/shareCase.ts`). Where sharing isn't available it opens a WhatsApp link with the text only. Each sent case is kept on the device (IndexedDB `cases`), and uploaded to the server when the farmer is signed in (see [Cases](#cases)).

### Areas

The app covers the main potato belt: every district of the Rangpur division (Rangpur, Dinajpur, Thakurgaon, Panchagarh, Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Gaibandha) and the Rajshahi division (Rajshahi, Chapainawabganj, Naogaon, Natore, Bogura, Joypurhat, Sirajganj, Pabna), and Munshiganj: 131 upazilas and 1,247 unions and paurashavas (city corporation wards are left out). `src/lib/areas.ts` reads `src/lib/geo/areas.json` (division → district → upazila → union, Bengali names and centroids); each upazila's outlines are in `src/lib/geo/shapes/<upazilaId>.json`, loaded one at a time by `src/lib/shapes.ts` for the map. The index is server-only.

Ids carry their district, since two upazilas are called Shibganj (Bogura and Chapainawabganj): `bogura`, `bogura-shibganj`, `bogura-shibganj.kichak`. Before more districts were added, union ids were bare Shibganj names (`kichak`); `unionById` still accepts them, and `npm run db:migrate` rewrites the ones saved in cases.

Boundaries are geoBoundaries BGD ADM4 (unions), each placed in the OCHA COD-AB upazila its centroid lies in; both follow the BBS 2020 boundaries. The May 2026 Mokamtala upazila (carved out of Shibganj, Bogura) and the union changes gazetted in June–July 2026 are not in either dataset yet, so the map still shows the old Shibganj. Bengali names come from [bangladesh-geocode](https://github.com/nuhil/bangladesh-geocode) (MIT), matched on the English spelling within each upazila; 83 that didn't match are written by hand in the script's `BN` table, which should be checked by someone who knows the area. To rebuild, download the three sources (links at the top of the script) and run:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/build-areas.ts <geoBoundaries-BGD-ADM4_simplified.geojson> <bgd_admin3.geojson> <bangladesh-geocode dir>
```

It stops and lists any name it can't match. To add a district, add its OCHA pcode to `DISTRICTS`.

The farmer picks district, upazila and union on `/planting`. The union id is kept in the `cg-union` cookie so the server can forecast for it, and its name in `cg-place` so a case shared from the phone can name the place without the index (neither is httpOnly; they hold nothing private). Home rewrites `cg-place` if it is missing or stale.

## Season ledger

`/ledger` is built on the phone for one field (a chip per field switches; by default the one Home showed) from its date, the sprays the farmer logs for it with "আজ স্প্রে করেছি" (on the ledger, and on Home's decision card on danger days), and the real weather since emergence. That weather comes from `GET /api/risk/season?from=YYYY-MM-DD&crop=potato|paddy`, which uses the forecast API's `past_days` (up to 92, no archive delay) at the farmer's union and the crop's rule. Sprays are kept in localStorage per field (potato keeps the key from before fields); the cost per spray (default ৳800, changed with "বদলান") is one per phone.

**Paddy shows no savings.** The comparison below is a potato habit; paddy farmers spray for blast around booting and heading, not weekly. A quiet paddy week is shown as quiet (`calm`), with danger weeks and the sprays logged, and no ৳ figure, until an agronomist agrees on a baseline.

`src/lib/ledger.ts` compares the season with the usual habit of one calendar spray a week. Each week from emergence is one of:

- no danger day, no spray: one calendar spray **saved** (+cost);
- a danger day and a spray: **sprayed in time**;
- a danger day, no spray: shown as a warning, no savings;
- a spray without danger: shown, no savings;
- the current week, or a week with any day of weather missing: nothing counted.

Before a planting date is set, the ledger and Home's pill ask for one instead of showing numbers. Cases sent to the officer (IndexedDB `cases`) are listed under the weeks.

### Offline

After one visit with internet, the diagnosis works with none. The model worker keeps the model, config and wasm in the Cache API. `public/sw.js` (a hand-written service worker, registered in production builds only) precaches `/camera`, the result screens, `/questions`, `/guide` and `/offline`, plus every hashed `/_next/static` file they use. Pages are network-first, so they stay fresh when online. Home isn't cached: offline it opens `/offline` ("নেট নেই — আবহাওয়ার ঝুঁকি দেখা যাচ্ছে না") with a button to the camera, so an old risk is never shown as today's. On the result screens, the weather row says the forecast is unavailable.

To try it, run `npm run build && npm start`, open `/camera` once, then stop the server (or switch the phone to airplane mode) and take the photos again. A service worker and the camera both need a secure context: `localhost`, or HTTPS on a phone.

`src/lib/diagnosis/__fixtures__/parity/` holds the notebook's reference outputs. `decide.test.ts` and `parity.test.ts` (which runs the real model with onnxruntime-node) check the app makes the same decisions on 12 notebook images (4 healthy, 4 late blight, 4 diseases the model never saw).

## Sign-in

Farmers and agriculture officers sign in with a Bangladeshi mobile number and a 6-digit SMS code. Nothing else needs an account: Home, the map, the ledger and the whole diagnosis flow work signed out, and offline as before. `src/proxy.ts` only guards `/account` and `/officer`.

Accounts use [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) (`src/lib/auth/auth.ts`, served at `/api/auth/*`) with its phone-number plugin. Users, sessions, codes and rate limits are kept in Postgres ([Neon](https://vercel.com/marketplace/neon), free plan, from the Vercel Marketplace).

- The number is written to E.164 (`+8801XXXXXXXXX`) from any local form, Bengali digits included (`src/lib/phone.ts`). The server accepts only that form.
- Codes are sent by [SMS Gate](https://sms-gate.app) (`src/lib/sms.ts`), an Android phone with a SIM in Cloud mode. A code lasts 5 minutes and allows 3 tries. Each IP address can ask for 3 codes a minute, because every code costs SMS credit on that phone.
- The first verified code creates the account, as a **farmer**. Sessions last 30 days.
- Roles can't be changed from the app. To make someone an officer, after they have signed in once:

  ```bash
  npx tsx scripts/set-role.ts 01712345678 officer     # or farmer
  ```

### Setup

```bash
npm i -g vercel && vercel link
vercel integration add neon            # provisions DATABASE_URL
vercel env add BETTER_AUTH_SECRET      # random, e.g. `openssl rand -base64 32`
vercel env add BETTER_AUTH_URL         # the site's URL, e.g. https://crop-guardian.vercel.app
vercel env add SMS_GATE_USERNAME       # from the SMS Gate app's Home tab (Cloud mode)
vercel env add SMS_GATE_PASSWORD
vercel env add CRON_SECRET             # random; Vercel Cron sends it to /api/cron/alerts
vercel env pull .env.local
npm run auth:migrate                   # creates the tables; run again after changing auth.ts
npm run db:migrate                     # the app's own tables: cases and SMS alerts
```

In development without `SMS_GATE_*`, the SMS is printed to the server console instead of sent, so you can sign in without a phone. In production a missing gateway is an error.

`/account`, `/officer` and `/sign-in` are not cached by the service worker, so no signed-in page is ever kept on the phone. Offline they open `/offline`.

## SMS alerts

The risk is only useful if the farmer hears it in time, and most won't open the app every day. So a signed-in farmer can turn on **SMS-এ ঝুঁকির খবর** on `/account`, and the app texts them the afternoon before a danger day.

- **Opt-in.** Turning alerts on (`setAlerts` in `src/app/account/actions.ts`) stores the farmer's union (the `cg-union` cookie) and a copy of their fields (season and planting date, which otherwise live only on the phone) in the `"alert"` table. Choosing another union on `/planting`, or changing a field, updates the copy. Nothing is sent to anyone who hasn't turned it on.
- **Schedule.** Vercel Cron (`vercel.json`) calls `GET /api/cron/alerts` every day at 10:00 UTC, which is **16:00 in Bangladesh**. The route only runs with `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`. In development without `CRON_SECRET` it can be called by hand.
- **What runs** (`src/lib/alertRun.ts`): it fetches one forecast per union with alerts (Open-Meteo, up to 50 unions per request) and, for each farmer, applies the rule of each crop **in the field today** (`cropsToAlert` in `src/lib/alerts.ts`). Without a field it assumes the usual potato season, as Home does.
- **When to text** (`nextAlert`): if today or tomorrow is danger, and the farmer wasn't already warned about this run of danger. As in the backtest's alert count (`ALERT_QUIET_DAYS`), a new warning needs two days without danger in between, so a week of fog sends one SMS, not seven. The latest danger day each farmer was warned about is kept per crop in `"alert_state"`. Each run claims a row before sending, so a retried or doubled cron can't send twice, and an SMS that fails is released for the next day.
- **The message** fits one Bengali SMS (≤ 70 characters, tested), e.g. `Crop Guardian: কাল থেকে আলুতে নাবি ধসার ঝুঁকি। আজই পাতা দেখুন।`. The crop's words are `smsWarning` in `src/lib/crops.ts`; paddy's says পরীক্ষামূলক.
- **Sending** goes through the same SMS Gate phone as sign-in codes, one at a time, at a lower priority than codes and with a 6-hour expiry. Without `SMS_GATE_*` in development the texts are printed to the console.

To try it locally: run `npm run db:migrate`, sign in, choose a union on `/planting`, turn SMS on at `/account`, then `curl localhost:3000/api/cron/alerts`. The JSON says how many farmers were checked, texted, skipped (already warned) or failed. A text only goes out on a real danger day, so most days it sends nothing.

### Paddy diagnosis

Everything but the trained model is in place: the camera's two-leaf flow, results, questions, advice, sharing, cases and tests. To turn it on:

1. Run [`notebooks/paddy_training.ipynb`](notebooks/paddy_training.ipynb) in Google Colab (T4 GPU) with the three Bangladeshi field datasets: [RiceLeafBD](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/kx9rx8p2mz) (Sylhet and Dhaka), [RiceLeafDisease-BD5](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/sjkptpgv79) (Savar) and [Dhan-Shomadhan](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/znsxdctwtt).
2. Unzip its `paddy_export.zip` at the repo root: it adds `public/model/paddy/`, the parity images in `src/lib/diagnosis/__fixtures__/parity-paddy/` and `docs/model-card-paddy.md`.
3. Add `'paddy'` to `PHOTO_CROPS` in `src/lib/diagnosis/crops.ts`, and run `npm test`.

The notebook pools the datasets, maps their folder names to six classes (ব্লাস্ট, বাদামি দাগ, পাতা পোড়া, টুংরো, খোল পোড়া, সুস্থ), groups near-duplicate photos by perceptual hash so no photo or near copy sits on both sides of a split, and splits by group 70/10/10/10. It fine-tunes EfficientNet-B0 with an "other" output trained on leaf scald, and calibrates on Bangladeshi field photos the same three things the potato config has: temperature, a conformal set at α = 0.1, and the "other" threshold. It tests on the held-out split, on narrow brown spot (never trained, so it should come out "unknown"), and leave-one-dataset-out, which is the closest it gets to a new district. Its export is in the app's own format, so `config.ts`, `decide.ts` and `combine.ts` don't change. The tests check that the config names the classes and Bengali labels the advice was written for, that the model file is there, and that the app reaches the notebook's decisions on its 12 parity images.

Paddy questions (`questions.ts`) each ask for one disease's hallmark, and are asked only while that disease is a candidate: any symptom at all (healthy), eye-shaped spots with ash-grey centres (blast), straw-coloured drying from the tip along the edges (BLB), a stunted plant with orange-yellow leaves (tungro), and grey-green blotches on the sheath just above the water (sheath blight). Paddy advice (`content.ts`) cites its source per disease: BRRI's 2023 blast and BLB alert for those two, and the Rice Doctor fact sheets (with IRRI) for brown spot, sheath blight and tungro. It names fungicide groups only where BRRI does, never a dose, and should be reviewed by BRRI or an agronomist. A paddy result next to the weather shows the blast rule's risk, labelled পরীক্ষামূলক.

## Cases

After sharing, the phone also sends the case to `POST /api/cases` (multipart: a `case` JSON part checked by `src/lib/cases.ts`, with its crop, and the two JPEGs, each up to 1.5 MB). Only signed-in users can upload, so the officer knows whom to call; signed out, the button says "মোবাইল নম্বর দিয়ে ঢুকুন". A case that couldn't be uploaded (offline, signed out, or no database) stays on the phone with `uploaded: false`, and `src/components/CaseSync.tsx` retries when the app opens or the phone comes back online.

Cases are kept in the `"case"` table in Postgres, photos included as `bytea` (`src/lib/caseDb.ts`). Create it once, after `npm run auth:migrate`:

```bash
npm run db:migrate

`/officer` lists the cases newest first: union, upazila and district, date, the farmer's number (tap to call), the app's result and answers, and both photos (`/api/cases/[id]/photo/[slot]`, officers only). Each case shows its crop. The officer marks each potato case **নাবি ধসা নিশ্চিত** or **নাবি ধসা নয়** (and can change it); paddy cases are for reading and calling back, with no verdict yet. `npm run db:migrate` adds the `crop` column to an existing table, with older cases as potato. The map counts only cases marked late blight, per union of the upazila shown, in the last 7 or 30 days. Its crop toggle (opening on the crop of the field Home shows) switches the weather colouring between late blight and rice blast; paddy has no case counts until paddy diagnosis sends paddy cases. Without the database the map still shows the weather risk and says the case counts are unavailable.

## Potato advice

`/potato` («আলু চাষের পরামর্শ») is growing advice for Bangladesh in short Bengali, one card per topic with read-aloud and its source (`src/lib/potatoGuide.ts`): soil and planting time, BARI varieties that resist late blight, when late blight strikes (December–January fog), bacterial wilt and brown rot, harvest, home and cold storage, and the diseases of stored tubers. The sources are Bangladeshi (BARC in the Daily Observer 2024, a Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University thesis on Dhaka's wholesale markets, a 16-district late blight survey, BAMIS, BARI variety trials, a CIP storage trial in four southern districts). One Indian review paper is used only for general facts, with its Indian places and figures left out; a test keeps Indian place names and doses out of the text. It is linked from Home and the guide, and cached for offline use.

## Guide

`/guide` explains each part of the app in short Bengali, with a read-aloud button per section (`src/lib/guide.ts` holds the text; keep it in step with the screens). Home's "কীভাবে ব্যবহার করবেন" button opens it, "কেন এই পরামর্শ?" links to its risk section, and it is cached for offline use. The first time the app opens, `FirstRunIntro` shows four cards (risk colours, leaf photos, spray log, set up) and ends on `/planting`. It is not shown again on that phone.

## Limitations and next steps

We say what isn't proven yet, in the app as well as here.

| Limitation | What we do about it now | Next step |
|---|---|---|
| The photo thresholds were fitted on **Indonesian** field photos, not Bangladeshi ones | Every result says "পরীক্ষামূলক"; the app says "unknown" rather than guess; uncertain cases go to an officer | 20–30 photos from Bangladeshi fields, labelled by an agriculture officer, run through `npx tsx scripts/eval-field-photos.ts <dir> --write` (folders per class, plus `unseen/`). The result is written to `docs/field-photo-test.md`. Then recalibrate on Bangladeshi photos. |
| The OOD check isn't perfect: 1 of the 4 unseen-disease parity images is called late blight with confidence ([model card](docs/model-card.md)) | Two photos per case, and the more cautious result wins | Measure the rate on the leave-class-out test set, and on Bangladeshi photos of other diseases |
| The weather rule has **not been matched to real outbreak records**, and its danger days depend on the weather model (Open-Meteo and NASA POWER agree on a third to a half, see [docs/risk-backtest.md](docs/risk-backtest.md)) | The Hutton criteria are a published, field-tested rule (UK); the backtest is public and reproducible | Get dated late-blight outbreaks from DAE or BARI for the northern districts and score the rule on them; compare against a BMD station's humidity |
| The **paddy blast** rule is a draft | Labelled পরীক্ষামূলক on every paddy screen and SMS; no savings counted | Confirm with BRRI and backtest against outbreaks ([docs/blast-backtest.md](docs/blast-backtest.md)) |
| The **paddy photo model** isn't trained yet, and its advice and questions haven't been reviewed by BRRI | Paddy diagnosis stays off (`PHOTO_CROPS`) until the notebook's export is in; Home says photos don't recognise paddy yet | Train it with `notebooks/paddy_training.ipynb`, publish its model card, and have BRRI or DAE review the paddy advice and questions |
| Pests aren't covered | A deliberate focus (see [Why potato late blight](#why-potato-late-blight)) | New crops and photo classes are registry and config changes |
| SMS alerts go through **one SMS Gate phone** | Sent one at a time, behind sign-in codes, one SMS per run of danger days | A bulk SMS provider once more farmers sign up |
| Bengali **read-aloud** depends on the phone having a Bengali voice | — | Test on low-cost Android phones, and hide the button when no voice is installed |
